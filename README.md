# Welcome to Sean Missingham's PC Configuration Repo

I use this repo to maintain the hardware and OS configuration of my daily-driver desktop, which also acts as a home server.

I use NixOS for the operating system, and host many docker container services. 

All of the configuration for that is declarative, and version controlled, right here in this repo.
